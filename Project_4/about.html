  <h2>Did you know?</h2>
  <p> Oil baron Jean Paul Getty converted part of his home in Malibu into a museum so that he could share his art treasures with the public. </p>
  <p> The Getty Villa was designed as a near replica of the Roman Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, Italy, which had been buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. </p>
  <p> Getty&rsquo;s will left virtually his entire estate to the institution in trust, giving it a greater endowment than any other museum in the world.</p>
